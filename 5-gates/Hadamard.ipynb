    "The importance of this result, as we already mentioned, is that one of the advantages of quantum computing is the ability to work with a large number of integers simultaneously in a quantum register of $n$ qubits. The easiest way to do this, since quantum computers initialize all qubits in the $\\ket{0}$ state, is to apply the Hadamard gate to each of the qubits and thus obtain a superposition of all the integers that we can represent with $n$ qubits.\n",
