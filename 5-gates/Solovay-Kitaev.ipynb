    "However, we would like to highlight the importance of this result, both from a theoretical and practical point of view. From a practical point of view, it gives us the advantage we were looking for, building a finite set of gates and having the possibility of implementing any other gates from this set. But perhaps its greatest importance is from a theoretical point of view, since it is telling us that we can approximate a unitary matrix of any dimension using only finite sequences of products of these four matrices, which is not a trivial result."
