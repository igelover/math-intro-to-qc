    "Let's go back to the idea addressed in the development of the EPR paradox, where we have two particles in the state $\\ket{\\psi^-}$ with a certain spin; remember that spin is an intrinsic property of particles that can be measured in an arbitrary direction of our three-dimensional space, and something important to note is that regardless of the direction in which it is measured, its eigenvalues are always $+1 $ or $-1$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In this approach to Bell's inequality, we start by making a measurement of the spin in three arbitrary directions $a,b,c \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. In this case, we can measure the spin in the direction of the $Z$ axis, in which case the observable would be $\\hat{\\sigma_z}$, analogously it could be measured in the direction of the $X$ or $Y$ axes, in in which case the observables would be $\\hat{\\sigma_x}$ and $\\hat{\\sigma_y}$ respectively. But note that you can actually measure the spin in any arbitrary direction of $\\mathbb{R}^3$, then consider the arbitrary directions $a,b$ and $c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we are posing the same scenario as in the EPR paradox, a pair of particles are thrown towards Alice and Bob and each can measure the spin in any of the three directions $a,b$ or $c$. Let us then make a table with all the possibilities of measuring the spin that these observers have, which would be precisely the way to derive the classical correlation that should exist between the results obtained from said measurements.\n",
    "    \n",
    "As we already saw in the case of the EPR paradox, the results are anti-correlated, that is, when Alice measures positive, Bob measures negative, as long as they measure in the same direction. In the same thought experiment of the EPR paradox, if we have three possible directions in which each observer can measure the spin of his particle, these $2^3=8$ would be all possible results that can be obtained.\n",

    "Note that the philosophical and physical implications of this result are profound. The underlying reason, at least the most widely accepted, why quantum mechanics does not satisfy this inequality, is because when constructing the previous table, it is assumed that the particle that the observer measures has a state and that at the time of being measured, you are simply obtaining information from that state that the particle already had. But quantum mechanics does not satisfy this, since by <a href=\"./Entanglement.ipynb#definition_4_2\">Definition 4.2</a>, when we have a composite system, there are certain (entangled) states, which cannot be factored by independent states, that is, it cannot be thought that each particle has its own state, but the only way to describe the state of both is together and when making a measurement on one of them, automatically the state of the other also changes, and changes instantaneously."
