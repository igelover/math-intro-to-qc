    "_Quantum Entanglement_ is a property that quantum systems have and that is fundamental in the quantum world. It is a complex property to understand and explain and is the subject of many discussions about its interpretation since we do not have a specific theoretical model that allows us to model this type of interaction. One way of looking at it is as the connection between the microscopic world and the macroscopic world, and it is a possible solution or at least one argument that is given for the measurement problem in quantum mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, quantum entanglement began to be seen as something \"weird\", after an article in which two classical, apparently natural properties of physical systems are addressed, and what is demonstrated in that article is that these properties (apparently natural) are incompatible with quantum mechanics, reaching an apparent paradox, which is currently known as the _Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Paradox_. Later John Bell devised an experiment designed to agree with Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen. In this work, Bell derived an inequality that could be implemented experimentally in order to show that quantum mechanics was an incomplete theory. However, experimentally the opposite was shown, that quantum mechanics is correct and what's wrong were the assumptions used in the EPR paradox.\n",

Obviously EPR's argument is that since locality and realism are natural properties of any physical system, what must be wrong is quantum mechanics. What was later concluded is that the concept of locality had to be redefined to make it compatible with quantum mechanics, and the concept of realism ended up being put aside thanks to Bell's inequalities.\n",

The background of quantum entanglement is that there are states that cannot be factored as a tensor product of two vectors, but rather that the system is in a joint state that cannot be separated in each of its subsystems."
