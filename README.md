# A Mathematical Introduction to Quantum Computing

This [repository](https://github.com/igelover/math-intro-to-qc) contains a set of Jupyter notebooks, developed as part of the final project for [QCourse 511](https://qworld.net/qcourse511-1/).

These notebooks are intended to be a Mathematical Introduction to Quantum Computing, mainly aimed to first years university students. The student is expected to have gone thru a first course on Linear Algebra and have some exposure to Trigonometry, Probability Theory and Complex Numbers. All exercises can be worked out with pen and paper, so no special software is required beyond the ability to run Jupyter Notebooks.

## Contents

- ### Introduction
    In these notebooks I briefly describe what are the issues that classical computers are facing and use it as a motivation for the need of QC.
    - Motivation
    - Logic Gates

- ### Mathematics for Quantum Computing
    This is the core of the project where the mathematical concepts are introduced.
    - Hilbert Space
    - Bloch Sphere & Qubits
    - Tensor Product
    - Linear Operators
    - Spectral Theory
    - Heisenberg Principle
    - Pauli Operators

- ### A (Very) Short Introduction to Quantum Mechanics
    Quantum Mechanics Postulates are presented and detailed how they can be used along with the mathematical tools introduced in the previous notebooks.
    - Quantum Mechanics Postulates
    - Time Evolution Operator
    - Worked Example
    - Projective Measurement

- ### Quantum Entanglement
    Quantum Entanglement is described using EPR paradox and how it relates to Bell theorem.
    - Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Paradox
    - Quantum Entanglement
    - Bell's Inequality

- ### Quantum Gates
    Quantum Gates are introduced as unitary operators and the most common quantum gates are presented. Motivation for a computationally universal gate set is given, rounding up with the Solovay-Kitaev Theorem.
    - Quantum Logic Gates
    - Hadamard Gate
    - Rotation Gates
    - Single-Qubit Gates
    - Multi-Qubit Gates
    - Solovay-Kitaev Theorem
