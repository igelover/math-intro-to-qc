# A Mathematical Introduction to Quantum Computing

This repository contains a set of Jupyter notebooks, developed as part of the final project for [QCourse 511](https://qworld.net/qcourse511-1/).

The idea is to create educational material for first years university students. These notebooks will have an emphasis on the mathematics and physics required for and used in Quantum Computing.

Please refer to notebook START.ipynb in order to access the following

## Contents

- ### Introduction
    In these notebooks I briefly describe what are the issues that classical computers are facing and use it as a motivation for the need of QC.
    - Motivation
    - Logic Gates

- ### Mathematics for Quantum Computing
     This is the core of the project where the mathematical concepts are introduced.
    - Hilbert Space
    - Bloch Sphere & Qubits
    - Tensor Product
    - Linear Operators
    - Spectral Theory
    - Heisenberg Principle
    - Pauli Operators
