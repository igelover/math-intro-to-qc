    "\n",
    "**1. The probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the expected value of the projector associated with the eigenvalue.**  \n",
    "**2. The state of the system after measurement is obtained by applying the projector to the state and renormalizing. The normalization constant is precisely the square root of the probability, calculated in the previous section.**\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have already mentioned, this formalism is useful when we are not so interested in what we are going to measure, but rather we are interested in the state of the system after measurement. That is, instead of verifying what is the observable, calculate the eigenvalues of the observable, calculate the probability based on the eigenvectors associated with these eigenvalues, etc. All this, that is required by the quantum mechanics postulates related to measurement in order to find a probability, is already implicit in the projector formalism.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, when we talk about measurements in quantum computing, we usually refer to measurements in the computational basis, and the computational basis is the basis of the Pauli operator $\\hat{\\sigma_z}$. So the observable that is almost always used in quantum computing is $\\hat{\\sigma_z}$, that is, when talking about measuring a qubit, we are talking about measuring the observable $\\hat{\\sigma_z}$ and calculating the probability to find the eigenvalue $+1$ or the eigenvalue $-1$ of $\\hat{\\sigma_z}$. The eigenvalue $+1$ is associated with the qubit $\\ket{0}$ and the eigenvalue $-1$ is associated with the qubit $\\ket{1}$.\n",

    "Observables are very useful when we are interested in measuring magnitudes that have a physical interpretation such as momentum, position or energy, on the other hand, in quantum computing we are interested in knowing if when the measurement is made the system will be in a state $\\ket{0}$ or in a state $\\ket{1}$, beyond the measured eigenvalue or the observable with which you are working. It is for this reason that this formalism of projective measurements is particularly useful in this area."

    "The goal of this section on projective measurement is to highlight that in quantum computing, when we talk about measuring, it is much more practical to ask about the state of the system than the value to be measured, which might not be so relevant in this context. For example, if we have a state $\\ket{\\psi}$ of three qubits, it is easier to think of calculating the probability of measuring $\\ket{010}$ than to think of calculating the probability of measuring a certain eigenvalue of $\\hat{\\sigma_z}\\otimes\\hat{\\sigma_z}\\otimes\\hat{\\sigma_z}$, which is actually what we are doing in the background but without the formalism of the postulates of quantum mechanics. We can say that in quantum computing the state of the system (the qubits themselves) is more relevant than the eigenvalues obtained from measuring $\\hat{\\sigma_z}$.\n",

When this topic is addressed, it will be clear that many times a measurement is made to project to a certain state that is being sought and continue with the algorithm from that new state. Therefore, being able to know the state of a system after a certain measurement turns out to be very relevant."
